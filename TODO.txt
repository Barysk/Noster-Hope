## TODO

* make an end screen with a score and buttons
	[resume playing] default
	[close game]
* make for players a separate hurtbox to battle each other and reverse changes on PBullet
* make an explosion slower
* try to remake shield ui into 3d

## IDEAS
* Make score a particle that being send every 30sec? and the player must catch it
	another player can catch it first
	GOOD THING: adds additional activity
	Problem: breaks core game loop
	Possible solution: Player that catches not his data gets a half
* add one more 

## DONE

make score go bigger if you possess any server
Implement new Health bombs, indicator of health,
	and also making an explosion when hit to destroy all bullets
