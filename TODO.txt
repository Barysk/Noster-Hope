I should make gracefull client exit on host disconnect

## IDEAS
* Make score a particle that being send every 30sec? and the player must catch it
	another player can catch it first
	GOOD THING: adds additional activity
	Problem: breaks core game loop
	Possible solution: Player that catches not his data gets a half

## DONE
tween now used through the function smooth_transition
